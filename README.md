## Project Overview 
---

 This project aims to analyze and interpret COVID-19-related data to gain insights into the pandemic's spread, impact, and trends. The project will leverage various data sources, including:
- Case numbers and demographics
- Visualizing key metrics
- Tracking and monitoring
- Identifying high risk areas
- Mortality rates
- Economic and social impact data

## Data Sources

The data presented in this dashboard is compiled from various credible sources, likely including international health organizations, government health departments, Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard and real-time COVID-19 tracking websites([https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus)). These sources provide up-to-date and accurate information on the global situation of the pandemic. We took a data source which is comprised of countries  of 250 different countries. This analysis  gives us the much-needed information i.e total death, total case, active cases, serious case, total recovery, population etc.

## Tools

Excel - Data cleaning,Data analysis,Creating reports.

## Data cleaning 

In the initial data preparation phase we have to perform the following tasks;
- Data loading and Inspection
- Clean the data to handle missing values, and also remove duplicates.
- Process the data to calculate derived metrics such as active cases (total cases - recovered - deaths), cases per million, deaths per million, and tests per million

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  EDA involved exploring the covid data to answer the key question such as :
  - Which continent have the highest recovered?
  - Which countries have the top serious case?
  - Which regions or countries have the highest case numbers and deaths?
  - Is there a correlation between total cases and active cases?

 ## Data Analysis
 
 - Perform necessary statistical analysis to generate insights using pivot table.
 - Identify trends, outliers, and significant changes over time.

 ## Results
 
   The analysis results are summarized as follows;
   1. USA is the most affected country with the highest numbers in total cases, active cases, and cumulative deaths.
   2. Countries such as Brazil, Russia, and Mexico also report significant death tolls and serious cases.
   3. The recovery rates are well distributed among continents, showing progress in fighting the pandemic globally.
   4. The distribution of deaths indicates a substantial impact in regions like Asia, Europe, and North America.

  ## Recommendation 
  
  - Continued Monitoring: Regular updates and monitoring of the dashboard to track the progress and emerging trends.
  - Targeted Interventions: Focus on countries with high active and serious cases for targeted health interventions.
  - Resource Allocation: Allocate resources efficiently based on the data to support countries struggling with high case numbers and serious conditions.
  - Public Health Campaigns: Strengthen public health campaigns to encourage vaccination and preventive measures.
